(1) Install ubuntu 10.04.4 lucid lynx 32-bit on machine
(2) Run update manager and download all recommended updates
(3) <if applicable> Install nvidia drivers

	(a) Download the driver for your graphics card from the nvidia website
		suggested location: /home/"user"/Downloads  -- should be a .run file
	
	(b) blacklist conflicting opensource drivers
		open a terminal and do the following:
		
		gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
		
		add the following lines:

		blacklist vga16fb
		blacklist nouveau
		blacklist rivafb
		blacklist nvidiafb
		blacklist rivatv
	
	(c) uninstall all previously installed drivers
		
		sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-*

	(d) reboot the comptuer
		When an error message pops up saying that Ubuntu cannot load Nvidia drivers, choose Exit to terminal (Exit to console)
		You should be dumped out into the command line, if not do the following:

			ctrl - alt - f1
			login as root (sudo -s)
			service gdm stop

		Login, cd to the directory where you saved your file, and run the installer

			cd /home/"user"/Downloads/
			sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-XXX.XX.XX.run

		Navigate through the menu and install. If it complains about the x-server still running then make sure you stoped it with service gdm stop

		
		Once it is finished and you end up back at the command line start the x-server agian:

			service gdm start

		ctrl - alt - f7 to exit

		You will need the following:

		Symbolic Math toolbox
		Optimization toolbox
		signal processing toolbox
		Image processing toolbox
		Statistics toolbox
		Mapping toolbox

	(b) Download the Matlab R2011a installer to the downloads folder ('/home/"user"/Downloads/')
		once it finishes downloading do NOT hit install -- exit the installer

	(c) open the Downloads folder and right click the Matlab installer.zip file, selecting 'extract here'
		you should end up with a folder like this:

		matlab_R2011a_glnx86_installer

	(d) open a terminal and log in a root

		sudo -s
