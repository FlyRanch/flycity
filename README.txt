Matlab code used to track the body and joint angles associated with arial manuvers in frutflies. Original work published by Ebrahim Fontaine:

Wing and body motion during flight initiation in Drosophila revealed by automated visual tracking. J Exp Biol. 2009 May;212(Pt 9):1307-23. doi: 10.1242/jeb.025379.

muscle_ephys branch contains modifications to improve traking performance during teathered flight experiments.
