function [alfa, beta] = aerdyn_ref_frame(Q_body, U)

%Function that calculates the angles alfa and beta between a body frame of
%reference and an aerodynamic reference frame.

%Obtain roll angle from body reference frame?

%Transfer velocity vector U into quaternion (w.r.t. global reference).

Q_U = quatnormalize(angle2quat(atan2(U(2)/U(1)),atan2(U(3)/sqrt(U(1)^2+U(2)^2)),0));

%Determine the angles between both quaternions.

Q_diff = quatinv(Q_body)
